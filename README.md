# Hi there, I'm sudosteak 👋

🎓 I'm currently studying **Computer Systems Technician – Networking** at Algonquin College.  
🐍 Learning Python.

## 🚀 A few things about me:
- Network enthusiast.
- Big fan of Linux (20XX is the year of the linux desktop trust).
- When I'm not coding or tinkering with my linux installation (and probably breaking something), you'll probably find me gaming.

## 🔧 What I'm working on:
- **[password_gen](https://github.com/sudosteak/password_gen):** A handy Python password generator because strong passwords rule.

## 🎮 Hobbies
- Gaming 
- Breaking/fixing things on Linux for fun
- Small homelab projects

Feel free to check out my projects or say hi!
